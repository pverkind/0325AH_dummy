    ʿAwnī, Makka 1423, pp. 113-115):
    * Su'ālāt Abī ʿAbd al-Raḥmān Muḥammad b. al-Ḥusayn b. Mūsā  al-

    in this manuscript, the full text of the risāla (except one
    authority)

    Abū
    al-Ḥasan in the paratext is al-Dāraquṭnī)
    * Mīzān al-Iʿtidāl, by al-Dhahabī: quotes the full text of the
    risāla  in his report on Ḥajjāj b. Arṭāh (who is mentioned in the
    risāla).
